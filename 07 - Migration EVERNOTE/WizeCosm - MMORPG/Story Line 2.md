The Story happends in the WizeCosm world.
![[image 3.png]]So the story line takes place in the middle of the Cosmer Era ( this Era happends after the Guardians Era, an Era where the Guardians hold the power of the legendary stones in some huges temples.)
![[image 4.png]]During the Cosmer Era, the Cosm ( Magical power ) has wildely spread around the world. While the purpose of the guardians has been forgotten, the cosm has altered the creatures of the world making it really hostile. Therefore the Cosmer Order ( A order of powerfull knights ) was created. His purpose was to protect the peaple from the hostile creature of the world.

  

Pretty quickly this order became one of the main political forces of the world. The order was composed both of Yamé ( people who express their cosm via physical abulities, so with very little magic, but strong bodies) and Gamé ( people that express their cosm via magical power, but have relatively commun bodies). At this time peace remain in the world and Yamé civilisation & Gamé civilisation collaborates.

  

This Era also meet with some of the greatest heroes that this world have ever known. While the competition to be at the top of the Cosmer order create some conflicts in the order, some Cosmer re-discover the old ways of the gardians and the great power that comes with it.
