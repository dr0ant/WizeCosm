1. **Game Conceptualization:**
    
    - What is the core theme or concept of the MMORPG?

		- The core concept of WizeCosm is to connect the game with real world environnement.
		 To do so, some aspects of the game will require real world actions.
		 The second big concept in WizeCosm will be its economy, it will be player owned.


    - What sets our MMORPG apart from existing ones in the market?
		- Many MMORPGs are based on a core system, also, recent mobile game development is rarely integrated with the core gameplay, WizeCosm will differenciante itself from its concurrents by connecting a core desktop gameplay , a geolocalisation mobile gameplay and a decentralized economy.

    - How do we envision player progression and character development within the game?
	    - First the character will start in his race origin region. Then after leveling up and being presented the differents aspects of the game he will be able to explore the entire world. 
	    - As the player levels up its gear will be more and more important as it should represent 50% of its power.
	    - The main quest will lead a narrative to visit leveling zones on the right order.
	    - Then at max lvl, each zone will be more independant, but a main quest will also appear.


1. **Target Audience:**
    
    - Who is the primary target demographic for our MMORPG?
		- As the game will be based on 3 gameplays, it can potentially attract 3 different audiences:
			  - The mobile geoloc (PokemonGo like) audience
			  - The Desktop usual MMORPG players
			  - The DeFi & artist ecosystem
		- These 3 gameplay are different in term of commitment :  mobile < defi < desktop
			- the aim is to attract both casuals, hardcores and technical audience


    - What are the key preferences and interests of our target audience?
			- medieval engaging MMORPG, multiplayer game, casual and hardcore, boys and girls; 
    - How do we plan to appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers?
	    - each gameplay can be independant even if its not optimal:
		    - for instance the geoloc gameplay can be played on its own and yields reward already interesting in order to progress.
		    - the main desktop gameplay can be played without the others but player will have to purchase items or resssources from other audience
		    - defi is basically a market, anyone can interact with it

1. **Game Mechanics:**
    
    - What combat system will the MMORPG employ? (e.g., real-time, turn-based, hybrid)
	    - for the desktop main combat :
		    - The combat system will replicate what ESO does : fluid and easy to understand.
		    - you can have up to 6 spells per weapon + main attack
		    - real time
		- for the mobile app combat :
			- combat on the mobile app will consist of 3 parts:
				- combat agains ressources gardiens : this one will be hybrid, pokemonGo Like but with your character.
				- combat as pvp : on the map you can create a "village" with a defense. the defense is played with creatures that you trained to defend your territory. this a turn by turn gameplay, like summonerswar
				- pvp offense : you attack some village with your own creatures.

    - How will players interact with the game world and NPCs?
	    - in each zone their will be tones of NPCs creating life in the universe.
	    - most of them will give quests but also explain the problematic of the zone
	    - The main story line will have its specific NPCs leading to dungeons and raids
	    - NPCs will also be present in the mobile app on real world point of interest

    - What role will crafting, trading, and player-driven economy play in the game?
		- crafting and trading will have a big role in the game. Only raw equipable items of low quality will be obtainable by looting.
		- Therefore crafting & enchanting will be mandatory to create items that fits the playser's needs.
		- Generation of ressources will be limited by several factors:
			- the mobile app will be the space of gathering ressources based on real world places. Each day you can choose what to want to gather, there will be 5 types of gathering :
				- water stuffs : basically near water 
				- city stuff : inside the busy areas
				- forest stuff : near forests and trees
				- montain stuff : near hight altitude spots
				- day/night stuff : stuff only availavle during day or night
			- the obtain ressources on those localisation will vary based on weather, level and score
			- the possible amont of resources will be capted to avoid cheating
		- Therefore, since there is a cap players will have to trade resources from to spot to some others, based on what is accessible for them and their needs
		- in the crafting section something interesting to notice will be patents, quality and parts:
			- patent are designs of style for items, they will be created by the players, when a patent is created the player can choose the max replicas, if its public or private. If its private the player will own the right on the patent for a limited amount of time, meaning only him will be able produce the supply of the skin, then everyone who has the patent can create. Tho if the player chose private and only 1 item the patent will be expired and no one can replicate the item's stile.
			- quality means that each items gerenarted will have a rang of bunuses setted randomly, then to improve the quality of the item player will need to apply smithmagic.
			- each equipable item can be separated into different parts which only affects style
